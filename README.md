Amazon Data Scraper gives you access to product, price, sales rank, reviews data from Amazon in JSON format.

I used Scraper API which is a service handling proxies, browsers and CAPTCHAS and it will return the HTML response from the URL I want to scrape, which is amazon.com.

The project is deployed on Heroku.
